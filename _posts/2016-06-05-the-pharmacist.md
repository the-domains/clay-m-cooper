I sat on the couch in a fog. I could not believe or understand the idea that prevailed in my mind. The moral dilemma came because I asked myself "Who am I to set in judgement on another?" My upbringing surely did not suggest it. I was a good person, why would I want to kill someone. Why not let the proper authorities, the system, handle it? Then it occurred to me that if the system had handled it, Jeremy would not be walking the street. He would not have been allowed to buy all the ingredients needed to make his toxin. His son would not have to suffer at the hands of the one person who should love him unconditionally.

I never meant to become the person I am sitting here now. When I graduated from pharmacy school, I was going to help people; to change the world, one patient at a time. Over time, the fire that burned within me was slowly snuffed out. Long hours, rude and inpatient customers, and thoughtless, incompetent insurance companies work fast to turn the passion of a profession into nothing more than the mindlessness of a glorified hamburger slinger at the local fast food joint.

At some point, I had checked out. I'm not really sure when it was but the embers finally grew cold. I still did my job. I filled prescriptions, counselled my patients, even helped the little old ladies in the community by delivering their meds on my way home from work. My heart, however, was not in it. I was a zombie; walking through the day waiting for 6:00pm. I had to reawaken that passion; to stoke those embers once more and find that true calling that I had when I began my journey.

Jeremy had been to my pharmacy several times trying to buy the last essential ingredient of his Trailer Park Tonic. He had been to jail a few times for possession, and maybe even for having a "shake and bake" bottle in his car. The guy was useless; a complete waste of breathable oxygen. Interestingly enough, it didn't really bother me that Jeremy was addicted to hillbilly heroin. If you want to screw up your life, that's your prerogative. He would answer for it eventually, in this life or the next.

My problem was with his son. Not _with_ his son so to say, but the fact that he had a son. His son was maybe four. He had been in and out of child services. He had been found in a closet covered with chemical and cigarette burns. Jeremy and his flavor of the week would get doped up out of their minds, sometimes even to the point of paranoia, and his son would reap the consequences. _This_ was my problem. I felt bad for the kid, I felt bad for his whole situation, and I felt bad that there were people in this world who could not have kids but would treat this one a thousand times better than his own father.

I went to the back and gathered the supplies I needed: five 30mg Adderall tablets, a mortar and pestle, a small syringe and some sterile water. I'm not sure why I used sterile water for that junkie; I guess it was the purist in me. I took the tablets and crushed them in the mortar and ground them to a fine powder. I poured the powder into a glass with just enough sterile water to dissolve the pills. After a little stirring and a little heat, I pulled the liquid up into the syringe, capped the needle, and placed it inside my jacket pocket. Killing Jeremy was probably the easiest plan to come up with. He was already a meth addict; all one had to do was simply push him over the edge. His death was nothing more than an accident wrapped up in a chemistry problem.

I drove by Jeremy's house, if you want to call it that. I've seen dog kennels with fewer holes. The dwelling was a shanty. I doubt it was even originally used as a home, more like a garage or storage shed. It was miserable. Trash was everywhere: liquor bottles, cigarette packs, fast food sacks and two broke down cars littered the front yard. I couldn't understand how people could choose to live this way. Even more appalling was the idea that the State would allow this guy to retain custody of his son.

I parked my truck just down the road in an old church parking lot. I walked back up the road, through the yard, and onto the front porch. I tried to be quiet and cautious. I wasn't sure what a dope fiend would do if he caught me trespassing. I stood at the front door for what seemed like hours but was only about ten or fifteen minutes. Everything was quiet, the only voices coming from a muffled radio somewhere in the back of the shack. I eased the door open slowly and found Jeremy passed out on a mattress on the floor.

My assumption had been correct. I knew he would be cooking within twenty four hours of scoring the Sudafed. Addicts seldom wait around for fear they will get caught with all the makings without getting the chance to use. He was out cold, a stupid grin on his face. I walked into the next room which looked to be a makeshift kitchen/meth lab combo. The windows were blacked out with aluminum foil and duct tape. More trash littered the floors inside just as it did outside. On the kitchen table, which was nothing more than a few stacked up milk crates and a piece of plywood, was a Coleman kerosene cook stove, a mixture of glasses and bottles, and various empty boxes of pseudoephedrine. The place was a sty. I know understand why these people feel like bugs are crawling through their skin. I was stone sober and I felt the creepy crawlies up and down my arms.

Jeremy started to grumble and wake back up. I knew I had to act now before he regained consciousness. I walked back into the "living room" and grabbed him by his right wrist. I pulled the syringe from my jacket pocket, tore the cover off the needle with my teeth, and jabbed it into the vein just below his elbow. At first he flinched at little. I don't think he was ready yet for a second dose, but as the contents of the syringe made its way through his body, his eyes began to roll back into his head and that grin began to creep into the corners of this mouth.

Just before he reached the point of ecstasy and passed back out, he sat bolt upright with his eyes bulging and full of fear. He grabbed his chest and looked down before falling back onto the mattress. Only this time, he was dead.

I stood and walked back to the Coleman stove. The odds of the M.E. finding anything to link me back to Jeremy's death were slim. I doubted there would be much fuss raised about a known meth head overdosing on a Saturday night. But just to be sure, I lit the stove and nudged a Claritin-D box next to the burner. It would only be a matter of time before this place went up like a tender box.

I walked back to the church and climbed into the truck. I could see the blaze growing and hear the sirens screaming across town. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I felt a rush of pride swell inside me. I had made a difference. I had done something meaningful. I had found my calling.

This was how I was going to change the world...one patient at a time.
