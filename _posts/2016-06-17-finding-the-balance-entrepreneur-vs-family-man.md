# Finding the Balance: Entrepreneur vs. Family Man

Finding a balance is something I'm sure all entrepreneurs struggle with. When I first explored this idea, my writing was pushing the blame off on other people. It started out that entrepreneurship is hard work (which it is) and it's hard to explain to people who don't have the same mindset as us (which is also true). I wanted to say that the struggle comes when my family and friends don't understand. They don't get that all my sacrifice is for us, for giving our family a better opportunity. If they could only see things the way I see things, I would come home every day to a ticker tape parade and the biggest \#1 Dad coffee mug ever created.

Then I read [The Art of Work][0] by [Jeff Goins][1]. Goins, a Nashville author and entrepreneur, started showing me that it wasn't just about what I accomplished at work or with my startup ventures. It's also about what I accomplish as a husband and father. I can't do that in the office or in front of my computer. He quoted Stephen King "Life is not a support system for art. It's the other way around" and that stuck with me the rest of the day.

I'd been mulling it over for a few days and then this morning I listened to his podcast The Portfolio Life. In [Episode 28][2]: Family First: Managing the Tension Between Work and Family, he and his host [Andy Traub ][3]where discussing the same topic which is why I chose to listen to it this morning. Andy was talking about another book [When Work and Family Collide][4] by Andy Stanley (now at the top of my "to read" list) when Traub said, "If you win at work and lose at home, you lose at life." I almost ran off the road. I felt like I was going to vomit. If that doesn't make you re-examine your priorities, you might want to check your pulse. My kids don't care how much money I make; they want their daddy. My wife doesn't care how many likes I get on Facebook; she wants her husband. My family is my support system. Without them, I couldn't do half the things I attempt. It's time to put things into perspective.

So how does this apply to the rest of you? I challenge you to do the same. Re-evaluate what you are doing with your time. I'm not telling you to quit striving for the next level; that would be counterproductive to our goal. Simply ask yourself: Why do you do what you do? Who do you do it for? Do your time and priorities reflect that? If not, it's time to find a balance. I'm going to fall short. I'm going to backslide. The goal is to appreciate the Why just as much as the How.
