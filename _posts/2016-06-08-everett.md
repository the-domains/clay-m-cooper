# Everett

Everett stood at the entrance to the massive cavern. He had devoted his entire life to this moment. His professors told him he would find it. His friends told him it was nothing more than a myth; a legend grown from a people long dead in a world long forgotten. His family thought him obsessed and maybe borderline insane.

But here he stood.

It had cost him everything. He had spent more Federal credits than his benefactors would supply. His reputation had diminished to the rantings of a lunatic. The university had dismissed him for failing to produce anything of significant value at any time during his tenure. His workers had abandoned him. His wife had left him. His children had disowned him.

But here he stood.

Over the years, he had questioned himself. If he was wrong in his research. If what people said about him was true. If the legend was nothing more than a fantasy. He thought about giving up. He thought about quitting. He thought about walking away.

But here he stood.

He carried the torch inside the cavity buried more than a hundred feet under the barren earth. The walls were hand crafted, carved from stone, and built by the sweat of a once proud civilization. The structure was awe inspiring in its architecture. Its intricate design was foreign to him. His world was cast in alloys and erected by machines. Gone was this devotion to design he now saw in the gleam of the torchlight.

Everett pressed onward. Artifacts lay strewn all around the chamber but he did not pause to examine them. There would be time for that later; time for categorizing and inventorying and labeling. He had to find it. He knew it was here. It had to be here.

In the middle of the space he found a large slab. The object was covered in thousands of years of dust but otherwise well intact. The materials were strange to him but he was nevertheless impressed by their lasting integrity. He brushed away the debris and peered through the clear protective material.

He had found it. His life's work. His complete passion. His grail. The writing was faint and aged but his eyes, trained by years of intense study, understood the cipher. He brought the torch closer to examine the ancient calligraphy.

He read aloud, "We, the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."
