2017 PICC Summary Report of Genetically Altered Tuberculin Influenza Pandemic

**Initial Exposure:**

On October 10, 2016, the Pandemic Infection Containment Council (PICC) received notice from Centers of Disease Control (CDC) concerning an increased mortality level related to seasonal influenza viruses and subsequent pneumonia. The CDC reported infection rates had increased from a traditional 21.5 percent average to 27.2 percent. The report noted the increase was isolated to urban populations within the United States and at present moment was being contained by local medical personnel.

On October 23, 2016, PICC received a briefing from the World Health Organization (WHO) detailing 15 cases of active _Mycobacterium tuberculosis _(TB) infection within a small region of western Italy. Of the 15 reported cases, 7 were fatal, 5 were listed in critical condition, and 3 in stable condition. The radius was established and individuals were asked to report to local medical personnel if contact had been made with infected persons, or if signs and symptoms of possible infection were present. Overall, an additional 67 individuals were treated for possible TB exposure. Medical personnel in the region continued to monitor for additional TB infection.

On November 12, 2016, CDC received an investigation request from Dallas Memorial Hospital concerning a 33 year old female recently deceased from suspected pneumonia related to seasonal influenza exposure. The patient had exhibited violent bouts of coughing producing blood from the mouth and nose. Based on symptoms, the patient was tested for both influenza and tuberculosis. Initial results tested positive for influenza and negative for tuberculosis. Repeat tests 24 hours later confirm the initial results. The patient expired within 72 hours of initial symptoms. An autopsy was performed and results confirmed influenza infection but also reported TB infection localized to the lung tissue. H&E stains of lung tissue were positive for caseous epitheloid granuloma and tissue samples tested positive for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis._ The patient would later be labeled as Patient Zero.

**Increase in Global Mortality:**

By January 27, 2017, CDC and WHO reported an increase in global influenza mortality rates from 19.2 percent to 34.6 percent. Fifty six percent of the deaths were attributed to symptoms similar to the case reports on November 12, 2016\. The majority of patients presented with a combination of TB and influenza symptoms, tested positive for influenza and negative for TB, and expired within five days of initial symptoms.

On January 29, 2017, PICC held a joint press conference with CDC and WHO officials stating the 2016-17 influenza season is being considered a Public Health Emergency if International Concern. The CDC issued guidance on infection prevention and requested lab specimens of patients expiring within seven days of influenza symptoms be sent to CDC headquarters in Atlanta. CDC and WHO announced a joint task force to monitor and examine potential causes for the increase in mortality.

On February 15, 2017, PICC increased the pandemic alert level to phase 4 citing an increase in overall infection rate to 36.6 percent and an increase in mortality rate to 41.3 percent.

**Genetically Altered Tuberculin Influenza (GATI):**

Tuberculin Influenza was first identified by CDC laboratories on February 21, 2017\. Though not fully understood at the time, CDC scientists released a report announcing the presence of a mutated strain of TB that carried influenza RNA components. The report hypothesized a genetic mutation in _Mycobacterium tuberculosis _RNA polymerase which severed the TB DNA strand instead of the unwinding and rewinding sequence. The broken DNA strand was then linked to the current H5N1 influenza strain and rewound. The report stated 887 of the 1074 tissue samples tested positive for the TB/influenza hybrid labeled as tuberculin influenza (TI). The increase in mortality was attributed to infected individuals replicating both TB and influenza. Patients' immune system recognized and attacked the influenza but failed to recognize the mutated TB strain as foreign. WHO confirmed the CDC findings on February 27, 2017\. Both reports could not explain the initial cause for the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis _RNA polymerase mutation and stated more research was ongoing. Detailed information can be found from the CDC:_Discovery of Tuberculin Influenza: A Cause of Increased Morality in 2016-17 Influenza Patients._

On March 9, 2017, the CDC released a follow-up report based on findings from the November 12 investigation request known as Patient Zero. The female's tissue samples and autopsy reports confirmed TI as cause of death. Further studies cited a genetic duplication on one copy of chromosome 20\. This duplication was later confirmed as the cause for the mutation of the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ RNA transferase. Since TI was now confirmed as a disease altered by human genetics the name was modified to Genetically Altered Tuberculin Influenza (GATI).

**Genetic Testing, Vaccination, and Quarantine:**

After WHO and CDC officials cited the genetic duplication on chromosome 20 as the root cause for GATI, PICC issued an Emergency Health and Safety Ordinance (EHSO) allowing CDC researchers to access the National Genetic Database and identify patients with the duplication. The incidence rate was established as 1 in every 30,000 people for a single duplication and 1 in 150,000 for a duplication on both copies of chromosome 20\. In the United States, identification and initial contact was completed by March 31, 2017\. At that time 76 percent of all people containing a single copy of the genetic mutation had expired with another 17 percent in critical condition with GATI. There were only 4 confirmed deaths of patients with two copies.

Blood samples were drawn on patients containing both copies of the chromosome 20 mutation and were tested against GATI. Initial results concluded these patients showed partial immunity to GATI while still replicating the disease. Cold and flu-like symptoms emerged in these patients but were mild in comparison with active cases of GATI. Steps were taken to isolate these patients from the general populous as a health and safety measure.

Attempts are currently underway to replicate the functions of the genetic duplication in order to process a vaccine and treatment therapy for GATI. To date, there have 23 variations of vaccines and 39 possible treatment protocols studied with no reportable cure or prevention statistics.

**Current Status:**

As of November 12, 2017, one year from Patient Zero, there has been an increase in the infection rate to 65.3 percent and a mortality rate of 71.2 percent. Sixty three million people (28.2 percent) of the United States population have died from GATI. An estimated 41.2 percent of the global population has died from GATI with a large majority of those deaths coming from economically underdeveloped nations.

GATI reached full pandemic status on July 8, 2017 when PICC increased the pandemic alert level to 6\.

PICC, WHO and CDC continue to monitor infection and mortality rates, provide guidance to local, regional and national health official, and conduct trials for potential therapy options. At the present moment, isolation and quarantine of all individuals, regardless of their expression of chromosome 20, is recommended.
