# The New American Dream

Today I took a trip through the southern part of Tennessee. The area we drove through is very rural, and I wondered how people make a living out here. They couldn't all be farmers, we saw no factories or major industrial areas, and the towns along the way were no beacons of economic development.

Later, I went to Wal-Mart for milk and gas. I know that Wal-Mart is not the place to find our nation's best and brightest. However, I looked around and fell into a depression. Hundreds of thoughts and questions flooded my mind and I wanted share them to spark a discussion.

### Is the American Dream dead?

I looked around and saw people barely dressed and unkempt. Cigarettes hung from lips or littered the parking lot. People made their own parking spots in front of the little booth between the gas pumps. These people looked lifeless, like zombies shuffling through their day. I wanted to ask them what were their dreams, the goals, their aspirations, but I was afraid of the answer. More worrisome than the lack of ambition was their contentment. They seemed satisfied with the status quo. As long as they had gas in the tank, smokes in their pocket, and a few bucks for a value meal, they were good to go. What happened to building something great, reaching for the stars, and leaving the world a changed place? Wherever it went, it was not on these people's radar.

### Our Founding Fathers

What would our Founders say about the society we have "created"? What would Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson, and others say about our political system? What would Martin Luther King Jr say about the content of our character? When did we trade "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" for "lotto tickets, free healthcare, and cigarettes at state minimum prices"? Where are those people who make profound statements like "Give me liberty or give me death", "I regret that I have only but one life to give for my country", and "Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country?"

### Is Entrepreneurship Real?

Entrepreneurship is more than being a small business owner. It is more than selling some "get rich quick" scheme. It's more than creating a product to sell to would-be entrepreneurs that teach would-be entrepreneurs how to sell products to new would-be entrepreneurs. It's about creating legacy, creating sustainability, creating more for life. But that's all I've seen lately. My Facebook feed is covered with posts about the 3 easy steps to success and my Twitter accounts are followed by people promising me the secrets to growing my business and making 10k by next weekend.

### Wrap It Up, Buttercup

I could continue this for at least a thousand more words, but for now, I want to open it up to you. Is Entrepreneurship real? Is the American Dream Dead? Should we be content with the status quo?
