![A Short Story](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/941339e0166f919e01e08958d4d7e5440aebd2da.jpg)

The report of the rifle echoed through the trees. The tranquilizer round covered the hundred meter distance in less time that it took Ryan to pull his eye away from the scope. The dart found its mark and the animal crumpled into a motionless heap on the forest floor.

"Lucky shot," Jackson said.

"Luck has nothing to do with it," Ryan replied. "Can't you recognize natural born talent when you see it?"

"Talent? Talent he says." Jackson climbed down from the makeshift sniper's nest and waited for Ryan to toss the rifle. "The last one took three shots. Was that talent?"

"Let's just tag this one and get moving."

The creature lay on its stomach; its head half covered in mud and leaves from the drug-induced collapse. Though motionless, it was keenly aware of every movement Ryan and Jackson made. Its bloodshot eyes never missed a step.

"I don't understand why we are tagging these things and not just killing them. They cause way too much destruction not to," Jackson said.

"Because it's not what we get paid to do and I, for one, like to eat. Let the other teams worry about extermination. Besides, that job is nasty. Murphy told me that each kill has to be sampled for brain tissue, mouth swab, and stomach contents. They have to do some half ass autopsy right there out in the open. Screw that!" Ryan said.

The animal twitched; a last attempt to move as the drug rendered it helpless. It had one consuming desire. It wanted to move, to advance, to hunt, to kill, to eat.

"Have they had any luck figuring this out?" Jackson asked. "You know like what caused it or maybe a cure?"

"I don't know, not that I have heard," Ryan replied. "Murph said he heard it was some kind of virus, like rabies or something." He pulled out his logbook. "You got that tag number?"

"Yeah. RIC2932." Jackson looked down at the blue tag in his hand and then over to the creature. "I hate this part. I mean, why the ear? That's gotta hurt."

"Nah, they don't feel it. And the ear is the best spot. It's easy to see through a scope so someone else doesn't try to retag it or kill it."

Jackson placed the tag over the long pin of the tag applicator. He bent down and grabbed the creature by the neck.

"Careful," Ryan said. "Watch those teeth."

"Not my first rodeo, Ryan," Jackson replied. "Besides this thing is out co...AHHHHH!"

The animal jerked suddenly and bit down hard on Jackson's foreman. Blood gushed down its face and onto the ground. The browns and grays of dead leaves came alive with the bright flood of crimson. Its arms grabbed and pulled at Jackson, bringing him closer for a more lethal bite.

Ryan slammed the butt of the rifle hard against the side of the animals head sending it rolling down the hill.

"I'm bit! I'm bit! Oh God, I'm bit!" Jackson screamed as he rocked back and forth clutching his gaping arm.

The creature stood at the base of the small hill and slowly made its way toward the apex. Each step was deliberate and purposed. It was hungry. It needed to feed.

Ryan pulled the Kabar from the sheath strapped on his left leg. He readied himself as he watched the animal make its ascent. He couldn't run. He couldn't leave Jackson. He had to stand. He had to fight.

Just as he was about to charge the monster, he paused. He recognized this one. Something about its face, its height, its hair. He glanced over to the left chest pocket of its tattered shirt.

"Murphy?"
